Will update later, but if I don't push this now I never will

There are some smells, and some issues to address

Issues to address

* Sometimes the continuation doesn't resume properly
* The iframe for the artifact preview is constantly rerendering
* Something about the artifacts is causing performance issues

Smells to address
* Some of the "requests" are smelly

Purpose: Not see "Usage Limit Reached" without having to upgrade to Claude's Max plan

BYO API Key

Everything (including your API Key) is password based encrypted and stored in your browser

In other words, there is no backend. The only network requests you will see are for loading the syntax highlighting and any requests you make to Anthropics API

Guest accounts are also encrypted with a default password so not really a point there but was lazy
