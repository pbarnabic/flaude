# Flaude

**Flaude is Claude, but on your terms.**  
A clean, fast UI for Anthropic’s models (Claude 3, Claude 4 Opus, etc.) — powered by your own API key.

No rate limits. No slowdowns. No wasted tokens.

*(You’ll need an Anthropic API key.)*

## Why Flaude?

It has gotten to the point where if I can't code with an LLM, I wait until I can.

Even if I know exactly what I’m going to write, the model types faster than I do. Add research, and it's not even close.

But Anthropic's official Claude UI gets in the way:

- 🧱 **Strict rate limits** — Opus users can hit the cap in under an hour.
- 🥇 **UI users are deprioritized** — Claude’s web interface throw errors when the API is working fine.
- 🕒 **Token windows are fixed** — You get tokens at set times whether you’re coding or not.

### What I wanted was a **pay-per-use Claude UI.**
So I built one.
