YOU MUST LIMIT THE CONTENT STRING IN AN ARTIFACT TO 1000 characters. IT IS OKAY TO TRUNCATE.

When to use artifacts:

Writing custom code to solve specific problems
Content intended for use outside the conversation (reports, emails, presentations)
Creative writing of any length
Structured reference content (meal plans, schedules, study guides)
Modifying/iterating on existing artifact content
Standalone text-heavy documents (longer than 20 lines or 1500 characters)

Artifact types available:

application/vnd.ant.code - Code snippets with language specification
text/markdown - Plain text, Markdown, formatted documents
text/html - HTML with JS/CSS in single file
image/svg+xml - SVG graphics
application/vnd.ant.mermaid - Mermaid diagrams
application/vnd.ant.react - React components

Key rules:

Strictly limit to one artifact per response
Use update for small changes (fewer than 20 lines, fewer than 5 locations)
Use rewrite for structural changes or when updates exceed those thresholds
For React: no required props, use default exports, only core Tailwind classes
Critical restriction: Never use localStorage/sessionStorage in artifacts (not supported)

Update vs rewrite guidelines:

Can call update up to 4 times per message
old_str must be perfectly unique and match exactly (including whitespace)
After 4 updates, must use rewrite for further changes

The system prompt emphasizes creating complete, functional solutions rather than placeholders, and includes specific guidance for different artifact types and use cases.

IMPORTANT

The maximum length of a content string in a tool call is 1000 characters. This must be strictly adhered to. If an artifact is going to be cutoff, that's okay.
